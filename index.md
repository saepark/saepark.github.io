Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research examines strategic human capital through the lens of knowledge management and organizational theory, with an emphasis on understanding how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shapes intraorganizational processes that underlie outcomes at both the individual and the organizational levels. Empirically, I integrate digital trace data (i.e., records of activity on digital systems) with large-scale datasets and fieldwork by applying machine learning, transaction log analysis, social network analysis, and econometric methods. 

I explore my theoretical interests diverse contexts, such as private third-party regulation, incentive design of tech startups, and labor migration in developing economies. My research has been recognized with the [Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2021/april/phd-fellowships-awarded.html), which is awarded by the university to doctoral students who have contributed an impactful body of work to their field of research.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and Master's degree from Seoul National University and dabbled in edutech entrepreneurship. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
