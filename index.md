Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory, knowledge management, and strategic human capital. I take a microfoundations view to explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives in knowledge-intensive settings affects intraorganizational processes that underlie organizational phenomena. Empirically, I integrate digital trace data (i.e., records of activity on digital systems) with big data and fieldwork by applying machine learning, transaction log analysis, social network analysis, and econometric methods. 

I explore my theoretical interests diverse contexts, including third-party regulation, tech startup, and labor migration in developing economies. My research has been recognized with the [Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2021/april/phd-fellowships-awarded.html), which is awarded by the university to doctoral students who have contributed an impactful body of work to their field of research.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and Master's degree from Seoul National University and dabbled in edutech entrepreneurship. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
