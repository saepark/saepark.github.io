Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shape agents' knowledge-related behaviors, focusing on how organizational control mechanisms intended to improve productivity can inadvertently affect flows of knowledge within organizations. My current projects examine this agenda in the contexts of bias in third-party regulation, informations systems usage in firms, and foreign labor migration in developing economies. My research has been awarded the Henry J. Gailliot Presidential Fellowship of Carnegie Mellon University.

I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
