Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory, knowledge management, and human capital development. Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shapes networks and performance. My research has been recognized with the [Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2021/april/phd-fellowships-awarded.html), which is awarded by the university to doctoral students who have contributed an impactful body of work to their field of research.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
