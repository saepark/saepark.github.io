Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory, knowledge management, and human capital development. I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shapes knowledge flows within the organization, focusing on both the content of knowledge and the ways that knowledge is sourced by individuals (e.g., by using information systems.) For my research, I was awarded the Henry J. Gailliot Presidential Fellowship by Carnegie Mellon University.

I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
