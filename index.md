Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. 

I will be joining the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto as an Assistant Professor of Strategic Management in July 2023.

My research examines strategic human capital through the lens of knowledge management, with an emphasis on understanding how the interplay of incentives and social relationships shapes knowledge and learning processes that underlie outcomes at both the individual and the organizational levels. My work considers how individual-level human capital characteristics influence the drivers of performance by the collective human capital pool, focusing on the antecedents and consequences of intraorganizational knowledge transfer and human capital development.

Prior to starting my PhD, I studied business and economics at Seoul National University and dabbled in edutech entrepreneurship. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins, and playing with my cat [Waffles](WafflesPark.jpg).
