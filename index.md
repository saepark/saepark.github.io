Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory and knowledge management. Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shapes how knowledge flows within organizations. My current projects examine this agenda in the contexts of bias in third-party regulation, informations systems usage in firms, and foreign labor migration in developing economies. My research has been awarded the Henry J. Gailliot Presidential Fellowship of Carnegie Mellon University.

I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
