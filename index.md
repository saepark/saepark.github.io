Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Strategic Management at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

My research examines strategic human capital through the lens of knowledge management, with an emphasis on understanding how the interplay of incentives and social relationships shapes processes that underlie outcomes at both the individual and the organizational levels. My work considers how human capital characteristics influence the drivers of performance by the collective human capital pool, focusing on the antecedents and consequences of intraorganizational knowledge transfer and human capital development.

I received my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University and my M.S. and BBA degrees from Seoul National University.

To non-Korean speakers, I usually go by Sae (pronounced as "say".)
