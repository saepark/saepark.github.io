Welcome! I am a third-year PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. I am interested in organizational economics, organizational learning and knowledge management, and behavioral strategy. 

Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives and market shifts shape agents' performance and knowledge-related outcomes. My current research examines these themes in the contexts of third-party regulation, information systems use in organizations, and labor markets in developing economies.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and Master's degrees from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, listening to music, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
