Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory, knowledge management, and human capital development. Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shapes networks of knowledge and individual and organizational performance. My research has been recognized with the Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship, which awards excellence and impactful research across the entire university.

I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
