Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of organizational theory, knowledge management, and strategic human capital. Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives in knowledge-intensive settings affects intraorganizational processes that underlie organizational phenomena. Methodologically, I leverage novel forms of data such as users' digital traces on electronic information systems by applying machine learning, transaction log analysis, social network analysis, and econometrics.

I explore my theoretical interests diverse empirical contexts, including third-party regulation, tech entrepreneurship, and labor migration in developing economies. My research has been recognized with the [Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2021/april/phd-fellowships-awarded.html), which is awarded by the university to doctoral students who have contributed an impactful body of work to their field of research.

In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
